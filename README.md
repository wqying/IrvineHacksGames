This repository contains two mini-games that were created for my team project "Dabble in Finance" in IrvineHacks2024.
The first game is a flappy bird game written in C# and created in the game engine Unity with the bird being UCI's mascot,
Peter the Anteater.
The second game is a dodging game create in the game enginge Godot, using its built-in scripts.
